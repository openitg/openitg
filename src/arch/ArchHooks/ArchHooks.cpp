/*
 * This is a helper for GetMicrosecondsSinceStart on systems with a system
 * timer that may loop or move backwards.
 *
 * The time may decrease last for at least two reasons:
 *
 * 1. The underlying timer may be 32-bit and use millisecs internally, in which case
 * the timer will loop every 2^32 ms.
 *
 * 2. The underlying clock may have moved backwards (eg. system clock and ntpd).
 *
 * If the system clock moves backwards, we can't just clamp the time; if it moved back
 * an hour, we'd sit around for an hour until it catches up.
 *
 * Keep track of an offset: the amount of time to add to the result.  If we move back
 * by 100ms, the offset will be increased by 100ms.  If we loop, the offset will be
 * increased by the duration 2^32 ms.
 *
 * This helper only needs to be used if one or both of the above conditions can occur.
 * If the underlying timer is reliable, this doesn't need to be used (for a small
 * efficiency bonus).  Also, you may omit this for GetMicrosecondsSinceStart() when
 * bAccurate == false.
