Discovered a bug where the Letter A, S-, C+, etc does not spin properly during
the post-song score summary screen.  The commit 334f186 introduces this bug.
since things compile and seem to work fine without it, I am reverting it.

The detailed description is:  The wrap function converts a float into an int,
so if you have a float smaller than 1 it becomes zero.  If you always add only
less than 1 to it (say, an angle or fractional value) it stays zero forever,
hence a letter no longer spins.
