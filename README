OpenITG - an open-source rhythm dancing game which is a fork of StepMania 3.95
with the goal of adding arcade-like ITG-style behavior and serving as a drop-in
replacement for the ITG binary on arcade cabinents.

TODOs:

1. Getting Started Guide - build and development
2. streamline build process - works out of box
3. streamline arcade build process - works out of chroot
4. test / bugfix beta-3 (currently master branch)
5. arcade revision sign utility
6. self-contained cache-rebuilding solution
7. OpenGL Driver uses fix function pipeline rather than shader

Very Long Term
1. Kernel source with ITG patches to rebuild kernels (talk to us, should live in a separate repo)
2. StepMania 4.0 LUA Bindings
3. StepMania 4.0 Theme metrics
