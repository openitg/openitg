	 *
	 * PLAYING: The sound is being decoded by the decoding thread, and played by the mixing
	 * thread.  If the decoding thread hits EOF, the decoding thread will changed the state
	 * to STOPPING.
	 *
	 * STOPPING: The sound is being played by the mixing thread.  No new data will be decoded.
	 * Once the data buffer is empty (all sound has been played), Update() will call StopMixing,
	 * and the sound will be changed to STOPPED.
	 *
	 * HALTING: The main thread has called StopMixing.  The mixing thread will flush the buffered
	 * data without playing it, and then move the sound to STOPPED.
	 * 
	 * The mixing thread operates without any locks.  This can lead to a little overlap.  For
	 * example, if StopMixing() is called, moving the sound from PLAYING to HALTING, the mixing
	 * thread might be in the middle of mixing data.  Although HALTING means "discard buffered
	 * data", some data will still be mixed.  This is OK; the data is valid, and the flush will
	 * happen on the next iteration.
	 * 
	 * The only state change made by the decoding thread is on EOF: the state is changed
	 * from PLAYING to STOPPING.  This is done while m_Mutex is held, to prevent
	 * races with other threads.
	 *
	 * The only state change made by the mixing thread is from HALTING to STOPPED.
	 * This is done with no locks; no other thread can take a sound out of the HALTING state.
