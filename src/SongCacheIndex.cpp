/*
 * A quick explanation of song cache hashes: Each song has two hashes; a hash of the
 * song path, and a hash of the song directory.  The former is Song::GetCacheFilePath;
 * it stays the same if the contents of the directory change.  The latter is 
 * GetHashForDirectory(m_sSongDir), and changes on each modification.
 *
 * The file hash is used as the cache filename.  We don't want to use the directory
 * hash: if we do that, then we'll write a new cache file every time the song changes,
 * and they'll accumulate or we'll have to be careful to delete them.
 *
 * The directory hash is stored in here, indexed by the song path, and used to determine
 * if a song has changed.
 *
 * Another advantage of this system is that we can load songs from cache given only their
 * path; we don't have to actually look in the directory (to find out the directory hash)
 * in order to find the cache file.
