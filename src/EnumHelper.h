/*
 * Safely add an integer to an enum.
 *
 * This is illegal:
 *
 *  ((int&)val) += iAmt;
 *
 * It breaks aliasing rules; the compiler is allowed to assume that "val" doesn't
 * change (unless it's declared volatile), and in some cases, you'll end up getting
 * old values for "val" following the add.  (What's probably really happening is
 * that the memory location is being added to, but the value is stored in a register,
 * and breaking aliasing rules means the compiler doesn't know that the register
 * value is invalid.)
 *
 * Always do these conversions through a union.
