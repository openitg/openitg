/*
 * Texture garbage collection policies:
 *
 * Default: When DelayedDelete is off, delete unused textures immediately.
 *          When on, only delete textures when we change themes, on DoDelayedDelete().
 *          This is what you get if you call LoadTexture() on a texture that isn't
 *          loaded.
 *
 * Cached:  When DelayedDelete is off, delete unused textures when we change screens.
 *          When on, treat as Default.  This is used to precache textures that aren't
 *          loaded immediately; use CacheTexture.
 *
 * Volatile: Delete unused textures once they've been used at least once.  Ignore
 *           DelayedDelete.
 *
 *           This is for banners.  We don't want to load all low-quality banners in
 *           memory at once, since it might be ten megs of textures, and we don't
 *           need to, since we can reload them very quickly.  We don't want to keep
 *           high quality textures in memory, either, although it's unlikely that a
 *           player could actually view all banners long enough to transition to them
 *           all in the course of one song select screen.
 *
 * Permanent: Never delete the texture.  This is only used for BannerCache=2 mode.
 *
 * Policy priority is in the order PERMANENT, CACHED, VOLATILE, DEFAULT.  Textures that
 * are loaded DEFAULT can be changed to VOLATILE and CACHED; VOLATILE textures can only
 * be changed to CACHED.  CACHED flags are normally set explicitly on a per-texture
 * basis.  VOLATILE flags are set for all banners, but banners which are explicitly
 * set to CACHED should stay CACHED.  Finally, all textures, when they're finally used,
 * are loaded as NORMAL, and that should never override.
