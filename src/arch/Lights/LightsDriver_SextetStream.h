/*
 * `LightsDriver_SextetStream` (abstract): Streams the light data (in
 * ASCII-safe sextets) to some output stream.
 *
 * *   `LightsDriver_SextetStreamToFile`: Streams the light data to an
 *     output file.
 *     *   The specified file may be a named pipe (Windows)/named fifo
 *         (Linux, others). This makes it possible to implement an
 *         out-of-process light controller without touching the StepMania
 *         source and without using C++. See the included notes for
 *         details.
