OpenITG, beta 2 (August 9th, 2009)
----------------------------------

If you're already using beta 1.1, some of the changes will be familiar. For
beta 1 users, this is all new. Regardless, there's a lot of new stuff for all.

This build includes multiple tentative USB fixes for the arcade, and we're
hoping it should prove to be more stable. My relatively short-term testing
held up perfectly. The slow loading for USB songs is being looked into as
well, and we expect a fix soon. There may be a minor incremental patch if so.
In the meantime, thanks for sticking around; it means a lot to us that you
guys stuck with it, even though it presented some major problems. Sorry
about the trouble this has caused.

For home users, this build features a lot of core engine optimizations that
should greatly improve the general speed and stability of the system. We've
overhauled RageFileManager and optimized the hell out of it, resulting in a
lot of speed-ups across the board.

A lot of minor tweaks have been added on top of the engine improvements and
bug fixes: PercentageDisplay can now go past 100% (for Getting Started), the
BPM meter on gameplay now scales to music rate, cancelled USB song loading
no longer causes jittering, song length for Long/Marathon is determined off
of steps length only, and we've added a ton of new Lua bindings (including
SetUpdateCommand for ActorFrame). Try them out: they're pretty awesome.

As for new stuff on the theme side, we've added preferences to tweak the Give
Up Time on gameplay as well as theme toggles for songwheel timer length, type
of credit (coin/token/card), and switching between logos. Just go into the
OpenITG Options menu if you don't think we've been hard at work. :)

As a final note, pat's added a probing driver that allows this build to work
with any ITG setup, encrypted or decrypted. This only applies to the arcade
version and /itgdata/, but that should make it work for everyone. Thanks for
the support, see you next release!
