These modules are not sandboxed or really checked for safety. They CAN 
and WILL crash the game if they aren't well written. Only use modules 
that you wrote yourself or that you know you can trust.

To call this feature 'experimental' is almost an insult to experimental 
works. The downside is that it'll behave in wacky ways. The upside is 
that you're in an excellent shape to help us develop it, if that's your 
thing.

Compiled modules go in Data/Modules/. The appropriate name (i.e. the 
second part of "LightsDriver_blah") should be inserted into LightsDriver=
in StepMania.ini (don't worry, it'll use more than one). This is currently
case sensitive, i.e. "stdout" won't work for the given Stdout driver. I'm
working on that.

Cheers, have fun!
