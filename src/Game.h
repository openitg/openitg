// PrimaryMenuButton and SecondaryMenuButton are used to support using DeviceInputs that only 
// navigate the menus.
// 
// A button being a primary menu button means that this GameButton will generate a the 
// corresponding MenuInput.
// A button being a primary menu button means that this GameButton will generate a the
// corresponding MenuInput IF AND ONLY IF the GameButton corresponding to the pimary input 
// is not mapped.
//
// Example 1:  A user is using a an arcade DDR machine as their controllre.  This machine has 
// MenuLeft, MenuStart, and MenuRight buttons on the cabinet, so they should be used to navigate menus.
// The user will map these DeviceInputs to the GameButtons "MenuLeft (optional)", "MenuStart", and 
// "MenuRight (optional)".
//
// Example 2:  A user is using PlayStation DDR soft pads to play.  His controller doesn't have dedicated
// DeviceInputs for MenuLeft and MenuRight.  The user maps Up, Down, Left, and Right as normal.
// Since the Left and Right GameButtons have the flag FLAG_SECONDARY_MENU_*, they will function as 
// MenuLeft and MenuRight as long as "MenuLeft (optional)" and "MenuRight (optional)" are not mapped.
