A-1: My songs are all offsync, so how do I adjust the global offset?

   To adjust the global offset, play a song you know is onsync (like
   Tribal Style) and press F6 twice until it says "Autosync Machine"
   (NOT "Autosync Song"!). Play the song - going only to the music -
   until it feels on-sync. End the song and save the sync changes.



A-2: I don't have ITG/ITG2 songs, but they're still in the songwheel.

   This is due to the sync fixes. If you don't have ITG/ITG2, for some
   reason, then go to /Data/patch/ and remove or rename patch.zip,
   then move "patch-no-songs.zip" to "patch.zip". The game will only
   read Data/patch/patch.zip, so the desired patch must have that name.

   Please note that "patch-no-songs-dec.zip" will not work - it is a
   decrypted copy with the updated data (minus song fixes, due to space)
   so people can see the changes we've made.



A-3: How do I assign specific USB ports to each player for memory cards?

   You need to set the following settings in the Static.ini:
	MemoryCardUsbPortP1 and MemoryCardUsbPortP2
	MemoryCardOsMountPointP1 and MemoryCardOsMountPointP2

   In Linux, you just need to set the OS mount point folders to where the
   memory cards are mounted by /etc/fstab (or your portable device daemon).
   You can get the correct Port settings with System Diagnostics. Place a
   device into the port you want to set, and a line will come up. The first
   part of the line has two numbers, "x-y": 'y' is the port number to set.

   In Windows, you will need USBDLM in order to assign a drive letter per
   port, to use as the MountPoint. I'm not sure how to get the port numbers
   besides trial and error. Sorry. We'll update this later with better info.



A-4: I'm getting a crash: "Parse error in ScreenOptionsMenu::Line3"

   You're using the 'home' theme without a patch.zip. The theme is built 
   off the OpenITG-patched 'default' theme, and will not function properly
   without it. If you didn't replace the patch.zip, then make sure it is
   in Data/patch/ and has the exact name "patch.zip". If you did, then you
   need to either incorporate the changes in patch-no-songs-dec.zip, or you
   won't be able to use the 'home' theme.



A-5: The game runs fine, but slows horribly/lags/dies on gameplay movies.

   Try setting "ThreadedMovieDecode=0" in the StepMania.ini. Normally, 
   the game does its movie decoding in a separate thread for each video, 
   to increase speed, but also takes a lot of processor power; if you 
   enable that option, it will decode movies during the game loop, which 
   will decrease quality somewhat, but cause quite a speed-up otherwise.
   If you're still having trouble, drop by the BoXoRRoXoRs forums and 
   let us know what's going on.



A-6: (Linux) Game refuses to start with a "Permission Denied" error.

   The binary, for some reason, wasn't set executable. That's how we
   ZIP it, but it seems to be finicky. To solve this, either run this
   command in the console:
        chmod +x openitg-beta-2 (or whatever the name is)

   or right-click the file, enter Properties or Permissions (etc.) and
   make sure that it's set Executable in there.

C-1: What's the difference between regular and SSE2 builds?

   Regular builds will work on all regular processors, but SSE2 builds 
   will only work on Pentium 4s onward, or other processors that have 
   Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (anything implementing x86-64, Intel or 
   AMD, will support it, but AMD 32-bit processors will not).

   SSE is an extended set of processors to optimize vector instructions 
   and calculation. If you have a supported processor, using the SSE2 
   builds will produce a noticeable speed increase with graphics 
   rendering and other vector operations (RageColors, RageVectors, etc. 
   will all perform faster). If you don't, it'll crash with an "Illegal 
   instruction" error. C'est la vie.

c-2: Why don't you guys have Mac/Xbox versions?

   The Xbox one is being worked on, actually. LightningXCE lent an Xbox
   for development and testing, and we expect a release in the future.

   We want to make a Mac version - yes, really - but we don't have one
   because none of the devs have a Mac and we don't know anyone who can
   (and will ) compile for it. If you know someone (or you have a Mac
   to spare), please let us know! You can reach us at:

   Registration is required, but free and very well worth it. Trust me,
   it's a great place for technical help, discussions, etc. and we do
   most of our user feedback polling there.
